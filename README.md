# surveyForm
This is a basic survey form i created for the certification project in freeCodeCamp.<br>
Picked a random image from Pinterest and then picked out the fonts i felt matched with the aesthetic.<br><br>
I am no graphic designer but i tried...

A whole day (CSS is rocket science for me) and i managed to make this form.<br>
Not half bad so i am leaving it at that.
